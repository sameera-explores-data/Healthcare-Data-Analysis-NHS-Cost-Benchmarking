## 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis & NHS Cost Benchmarking
<p align="justify"> 
A comprehensive healthcare data analytics project focused on internal patient records, cost efficiency, and national tariff comparison. This project leverages SQL and Power BI to deliver strategic insights into treatment costs, diagnosis trends, and regional health patterns.
</p>

## 📘 Project Overview
<p align="justify">
This analysis aims to support healthcare decision-making through the exploration of structured patient treatment data, cost benchmarking against NHS tariffs, and demographic-based insights. It ensures data integrity, transparency, and actionable reporting through a rigorous SQL-driven methodology and Power BI visualizations.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and validate internal healthcare datasets
- Analyze high-frequency diagnoses and cost trends
- Benchmark internal costs against NHS tariff standards
- Assess demographic impact on healthcare outcomes
- Identify geographic patterns in healthcare demand
- Deliver interactive, insight-driven dashboards via Power BI

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL — for data structuring, cleaning, and Trend extraction.
- Power BI — for real-time, interactive dashboards

## 🗃️ Dataset and Preprocessing using SQL
- Missing Values: No null values detected across features
- Standardization: Unified column names and SQL-compatible date formats
- Data Types: Converted appropriate fields for query efficiency
- Outlier Detection: No irregular values detected
- Structured Insights: Records organized by diagnosis codes, treatments, cost, and visit frequency
- Over 60% of internal treatments exceeded NHS tariff guidelines, highlighting potential cost optimization opportunities.

## Conclusions
<p align="justify">
The analysis reveals that diagnosis patterns vary across genders, with some conditions being more common in one gender than the other. This insight can help tailor healthcare interventions more effectively.
</p>

## Recommendations
<p align="justify">
Healthcare providers should use gender-specific trends to improve diagnosis accuracy and target health education programs to the right audience.
